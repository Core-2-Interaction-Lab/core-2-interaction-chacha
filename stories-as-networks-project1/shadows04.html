          In 
             
        <span class="g glo"> temple</span> 
        <span class="g glo"> architecture </span>
        the 
        <span class="g glo">main </span>
        <span class="g glo"> room </span>
        stands
         at 
         a 
         considerable 
         <span class="g glo">distance </span>
         from 
         the 
         <span class="g glo">garden; </span>
         so 
         dilute 
         is 
         the 
         <span class="g glo">light </span>
         there 
         that 
         no 
         matter 
         what the 
         <span class="g glo">season, on </span>
         <span class="g glo">fair </span>
         <span class="g glo">days </span>
            or 
            <span class="g glo">cloudy, </span>
            <span class="g glo"> morning, </span>
            <span class="g glo"> midday, </span>
         or 
         <span class="g glo">evening, </span>
         the <span class="g glo">pale, </span>
         <span class="g glo">white 
         glow </span>
         scarcely 
         varies. 
         And 
         the 
         <span class="g glo">shadows </span>
         at 
         the 
         <span class="g glo">interstices</span>
             of the 
             <span class="g glo">ribs seem strangely immobile,</span>
                 as if dust collected in the corners had 
                 <span class="g glo">become a part of the paper itself. </span>

                 I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, 
                 feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision. 
                 The 
                 <span class="g glo">light </span>
                    from the 
                    <span class="g glo">pale white paper, </span>
                 powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, 
                 is instead 
                 <span class="g glo">repelled by the darkness, </span>
                    creating a world of 
                    <span class="g glo">confusion </span>
                        where 
                        <span class="g glo">dark and light are indistinguishable.</span>
                Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, 
                a rare tranquility not found in 
                <span class="g glo">ordinary light? </span>
                Have you never felt a sort of
                <span class="g glo"> fear in the face of the ageless,</span>
             a fear that in that room you might lose all 
             <span class="g glo">consciousness of the passage of time,</span>
                 that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find you had 
                 <span class="g glo">grown old and gray?</span>
<br><br>
        And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms 
        of these huge buildings, to which 
        sunlight never penetrates, how 
        <span class="g glo">the gold leaf</span>
         of a 
         <span class="g glo">sliding door </span>
         or 
         <span class="g glo">screen </span>
            will pick up a distant glimmer from 
            <span class="g glo">the garden, </span>
                then suddenly send forth an 
                <span class="g glo">ethereal glow, </span>
                 faint 
                 <span class="g glo">golden light </span>
                    cast into the 
                    <span class="g glo">enveloping darkness, </span>
                     the glow upon the 
                     <span class="g glo">horizon at sunset. </span>
                        In no other setting is gold quite so 
                        <span class="g glo">exquisitely beautiful. </span>
            You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; 
            and as you move away the golden surface of 
            <span class="g glo">the paper glows ever more deeply,</span>
                 changing not in a flash, but growing slowly, 
                 steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a 
                 <span class="g glo">giant.</span>
         Or again you may find that the gold dust of the background,
          which until that moment had only a 
          dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past, 
          suddenly gleam forth as if it had 
          
          <span class="g glo"> burst into flame.</span>
        
        How, in such a 
        <span class="g glo"> dark place, </span>
            gold draws so much 
            <span class="g glo">light </span>
                to itself is a 
                <span class="g glo">mystery</span>
                     to me. But I see why in ancient times statues of the 
                     <span class="g glo">Buddha</span>
                         were gilt with gold and why 
                         <span class="g glo">gold leaf </span>
                            covered the walls of the homes of 
                            <span class="g glo">the nobility.</span>
            Modem man, in his well-lit house, 
            knows nothing of the 
            <span class="g glo">beauty of gold; </span>
                but those who lived in the 
                <span class="g glo">dark houses </span>
                    of the past were not merely captivated by 
                    <span class="g glo">its beauty, </span>
                        they also knew its practical value; 
                        <span class="g glo">for gold,</span>
                in these 
                <span class="g glo">dim rooms,</span> 
                must have served the 
                <span class="g glo">function of a reflector. </span>
            Their use of 
            <span class="g glo">gold leaf and gold dust </span>
                was not mere extravagance. 
                Its reflective properties were put to use as a source of 
                <span class="g glo">illumination. </span>
                    Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss,
                     but 
                     <span class="g glo">gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. </span>
                        This is why gold was held in such incredibly 
                        <span class="g glo">high esteem. </span>
